If we have a common, house-hold washing machine at our disposal &mdash; the <em>procedure</em>, may look something like this:</p><ol><li><p>split the laundry into whites and colours;</p></li><li><p>wash whites;</p></li><li><p>wash colours;</p></li><li><p>dry the laundry;</p></li><li><p>neatly stack up the laundry.</p></li></ol><p>In a conventional functional programming language, such as SML, this may end up looking like this:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.0' href='#L.0.0'>Listing 0.0</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>(stack (dry (wash (split laundry))))</pre></li></ol></code><p>While comprehensible, this does not read very well. Most languages we&#8217;re used to, i.e. <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-european'>Indo-European languages</a>, read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Here, the flow of the program is expressed right-to-left, and there is no notion of top-down descent at all. If anything, there&#8217;s a notion of bottom-up ascent, if we for instance, lay out the program like this:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.1' href='#L.0.1'>Listing 0.1</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>(stack</pre></li><li><pre>  (dry</pre></li><li><pre>    (wash</pre></li><li><pre>      (split laundry))))</pre></li></ol></code><p>This reads like we&#8217;re putting the cart before the horse. Indeed, some tasks &mdash; such as, doing the laundry, cooking a meal, writing a program, etc. &mdash; are inherently sequential, i.e. they are done by performing a sequence of steps. Functional programming languages can be <span class='tooltip' title='A programming language has syntactic rules defining the valid positioning of symbols. In this case, the syntactic rule is that the name precedes the arguments in a function call.'>syntactically</span> unfit for writing such programs well.</p><p>We will develop the notion of a <em>well-written program</em> throughout these lecture notes, but we begin with the following definition:</p><a class='margin' name='D.0.0' href='#D.0.0'>Definition 0.0</a><dfn><p>A well-written program is a well-read program.</p></dfn><p>That is, a well-written program is comprehensible to another programmer. Naturally, not any old programmer will do, but someone with relative knowledge of the problem domain, and programming experience comparable, or superceeding yours, should be able to comprehend and evaluate your programs. The intent is to facilitate a the review and evolution of your programs by your peers.</p><p>We were also somewhat <em>declarative</em> when we wrote the functional program. For instance, we&#8217;ve left out the fact that we should wash whites before we wash colours. Actually, we didn&#8217;t even mention that we split the laundry into whites and colours; we&#8217;ve left it up to the <var>wash</var> and <var>split</var> functions to discuss such &#8220;details&#8221;.</p><a class='margin' name='D.0.1' href='#D.0.1'>Definition 0.1</a><dfn><p>A declarative style of programming is a style where we tell the reader &#8220;what&#8221; we&#8217;re doing, rather than &#8220;how&#8221; we&#8217;re doing it.</p></dfn><p>An alternative functional program could be:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.2' href='#L.0.2'>Listing 0.2</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>let</pre></li><li><pre>  (dirtyWhites, dirtyColours) = split dirtyLaundry</pre></li><li><pre>  cleanWetWhites = wash dirtyWhites</pre></li><li><pre>  cleanWetColours = wash dirtyColours</pre></li><li><pre>  cleanLaundry = dry (cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours)</pre></li><li><pre>in</pre></li><li><pre>  stack cleanLaundry</pre></li></ol></code><p>We&#8217;ll refer to lines 1&ndash;7 as a &#8220;<tt>let</tt>-block&#8221;, lines 2&ndash;4 as a &#8220;<tt>let</tt>-definitions&#8221;, and line 7 as a &#8220;<tt>let</tt>-expression&#8221;.</p><p>In functional programming, the <tt>let</tt>-syntax can be used to reduce the complexity of an expression by giving intuitive names to some of its constituents. This allows the reader to read the expression, and delve into the details, if the reader wishes to do so. As long as important deails are retained, this is a useful technique for making your programs more readable.</p><p>In this particular case, the expression reduces to simply <code>stack cleanLaundry</code>. This seems overly declarative. We&#8217;re completely disregarding the important aspects of &#8220;doing the laundry&#8221;. We&#8217;re so eager not to tell the reader &#8220;how&#8221; we&#8217;re doing it, that we forget to tell the reader &#8220;what&#8221; we&#8217;re doing.</p><p>The <tt>let</tt>-syntax does however provide for a nice segway into another <span class='tooltip' title='A way of writing a particular class of programms well.'>programming paradigm</span>, more suitable for writing <em>procedures</em> like this. In particular, the <tt>let</tt>-syntax provides more than a simple mechanism for naming subexpressions. Notice, how we could use the name <var>dirtyWhites</var> when we defined <var>cleanWetWhites</var>, or how we could use <var>cleanWetWhites</var> when we defined <var>cleanLaundry</var>.</p><p>It is as if some sort of &#8220;state&#8221; is retained from one defintion to the next, in the sense that a name defined further up can be used in definitions further down. If we represent &#8220;state&#8221; as the set of names available for use in an expression we can specify how the state develops throughout the <tt>let</tt>-block: </p><a class='margin' name='L.0.3' href='#L.0.3'>Listing 0.3</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>let</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry}</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours}</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours,</pre></li><li><pre>    cleanWetWhites}</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours,</pre></li><li><pre>    cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours}</pre></li><li><pre>in</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours,</pre></li><li><pre>    cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours, cleanLaundry}</pre></li></ol></code><p>It seems overly excessive to have the state at the <tt>let</tt>-expression (lines 9&ndash;10) contain all these &#8220;intermediate&#8221; names, such as <var>dirtyWhites</var>, <var>cleanWetColours</var>, etc. All we really want in the <tt>let</tt>-expression is the <var>cleanLaundry</var>. What&#8217;s more, it does not conceptually make sense to be able to use the dirty, or wet laundry once the laundry has been washed and dried, right? Indeed, we&#8217;d like for the state develop in a fashion similar to the following:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.4' href='#L.0.4'>Listing 0.4</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>{dirtyLaundry}</pre></li><li><pre>{dirtyWhites, dirtyColours}</pre></li><li><pre>{cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours}</pre></li><li><pre>{cleanDryLaundry}</pre></li></ol></code><p>While we could attempt to fix this using nested <tt>let</tt>-blocks or <span class='tooltip' title='Functions whos sole purpose is to make other functions easier to comprehend.'>auxiliary functions</span>, the final code will not be as easy as 1-2-3-4-5, i.e. as simple as our initial specification of the procedure.</p><p>The thing that is getting in the way here is that in the functional paradigm we&#8217;re dealing with <em>immutable</em> values. That is, values that can be created and destroyed, but not modified. Indeed, if the pile of laundry was a <em>mutable</em> value, we could simply step-wise modify that value from a dirty pile to a clean stack. After-all, this resembles what we do with the laundry in real life.</p><p>Let us concentrate around a single statement:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.5' href='#L.0.5'>Listing 0.5</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>dirtyWhites, dirtyColours = split(dirtyLaundry)</pre></li></ol></code><p>If we let <var>dirtyLaundry</var> be a basket of mixed dirty laundry, we&#8217;de like for the effect of this <em>assignment</em> to be that <var>dirtyWhites</var> becomes a pile of dirty whites, and <var>dirtyColours</var> becomes a pile of dirty colours, while <var>dirtyLaundry</var> becomes an <em>empty</em> basket. That is, we&#8217;d like the laundry is <em>moved</em> from the basket to the respective piles.</p><p>An alternative programming paradigm, the <em>imperative</em>, allows us to write the program like this:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.6' href='#L.0.6'>Listing 0.6</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>splitDirtyLaundry(laundry)</pre></li><li><pre>washWhites(laundry)</pre></li><li><pre>washColours(laundry)</pre></li><li><pre>dry(laundry)</pre></li><li><pre>stack(laundry)</pre></li></ol></code><p>Here, <var>laundry</var> is a value that begins as a pile of dirty laundry. In step 1, it is <em>transformed</em> into another value: a pair of piles &mdash; whites and colours. At this point, we can think of <var>laundry</var> as a container, say a two-compartment basket. We can then access the piles in the respective compartments using what is known as the <em>dot-syntax</em>, i.e. <var>laundry.whites</var> and <var>laundry.colours</var>. After the laundry is washed, it is put back in the same compartment. In step 4, we pick up the laundry from both compartments and hang it up to dry. The laundry is thus transformed into a clean, dry pile of laundry. In the last step, we simply take this pile and neatly stack it. The resulting <var>laundry</var> is hence a neat stack of clean, dry laundry.</p><a class='margin' name='D.0.2' href='#D.0.2'>Definition 0.2</a><dfn><p> An immutable value does not change. </p></dfn><p>In the functional paradigm, we&#8217;re programming by defining mathematical functions.
