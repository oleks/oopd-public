If we have a common, house-hold washing machine at our disposal &mdash; the <em>routine</em>, may look something like this:</p><ol><li><p>split the laundry into whites and colours;</p></li><li><p>wash whites;</p></li><li><p>wash colours;</p></li><li><p>dry the laundry;</p></li><li><p>neatly pile up the laundry.</p></li></ol><p>In a conventional functional programming language, such as SML, this may end up looking like this:</p><pre><code>(pile (dry (wash (split laundry))))</code></pre><p>While comprehensible, this does not read very well. Most languages we&#8217;re used to, i.e. <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-european'>Indo-European</a> languages, read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Here, the flow of the program is expressed right-to-left, and there is no notion of top-down descent at all. If anything, there&#8217;s a notion of bottom-up ascent, if we for instance, lay out the program like this:</p><pre><code>(pile
  (dry
    (wash
      (split laundry))))</code></pre><p>This reads like we&#8217;re putting the cart before the horse. Indeed, some tasks &mdash; such as, doing the laundry, cooking a meal, writing a program, etc. &mdash; are inherently sequential. Functional programming languages can be <span class='tooltip' title='A programming language has syntactic rules defining the valid positioning of symbols. In this case, the syntactic rule is that the name precedes the arguments in a function call.'>syntactically</span> unfit for writing such programs well.</p><p>We will develop the notion of a <em>well-written program</em> throughout these lecture notes, but we begin with the following definition:</p><dfn><p>A well-written program is a well-read program.</p></dfn><p>That is, a well-written program is comprehensible to another programmer. Naturally, not any old programmer will do, but someone with relative knowledge of the problem domain, and programming experience comparable, or superceeding yours, should be able to comprehend and evaluate your programs. The intent is to facilitate a the review and evolution of your programs by your peers.</p><p>We were also somewhat <em>declarative</em> when we wrote the functional program. For instance, we&#8217;ve left out the fact that we should wash whites before we wash colours. Actually, we didn&#8217;t even mention that we split the laundry into whites and colours; we&#8217;ve left it up to the <var>wash</var> and <var>split</var> function definitions to discuss such &#8220;details&#8221;.</p><dfn><p>A declarative style of programming is a style where we tell the reader &#8220;what&#8221; we&#8217;re doing, rather than &#8220;how&#8221; we&#8217;re doing it.</p></dfn><p>An alternative functional program for the task could be:</p><pre><code>let
  (dirtyWhites, dirtyColours) = split dirtyLaundry
  cleanWetWhites = wash dirtyWhites
  cleanWetColours = wash dirtyColours
  cleanLaundry = dry (cleanWetWhites ++ cleanWetColours)
in
  pile cleanLaundry</code></pre><p>In regular functional programming, the <code>let</code>-syntax.</p><p><b>Assignment</b></p><p>ASCII report.</p><p>The DIKU canteen is the only completely student-driven canteen on the Copenhagen University campus. The canteen was established in 1971, and runs till this day. As a student-driven canteen, even the accounting is done by students. No biggie for Datalogy students, eh? We&#8217;ll see.</p><p>It is possible to buy from the canteen in bulk. The usual order consists of perhaps 30 bottles of soft drinks, and 30 bottles of beer. Although all soft drinks have the same price, beer prices may vary depending on how enthusiastic you are about beer. Indeed, DIKU alumni and research groups can be quite a picky bunch when it comes to beer specialities. We can without loss of generality constrain ourselves to beer.</p><p>Every time a bulk purchase is made, the items and quantities purchased are noted in a journal, leaving it to accounting to handle later.</p><p>This is where you come in. We need to write a program that can process the journal and produce a summary report in ASCII. The summary report should process the entire journal and provide as output:</p><ul><li><p>the total number of times each type of beer was purchased;</p></li><li><p>the total revenue made from each type of beer;</p></li><li><p>the overall revenue from bulk purchases;</p></li><li><p>an overview of the development of the revenue over time.</p></li></ul><pre><code>Guld Tuborg 10
