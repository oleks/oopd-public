If we have a common, house-hold washing machine at our disposal &mdash; the <em>procedure</em>, may look something like this:</p><ol><li><p>split the laundry into whites and colours;</p></li><li><p>wash whites;</p></li><li><p>wash colours;</p></li><li><p>dry the laundry;</p></li><li><p>neatly stack up the laundry.</p></li></ol><p>In a conventional functional programming language, such as SML, this may end up looking like this:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.0' href='#L.0.0'>Listing 0.0</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>(stack (dry (wash (split laundry))))</pre></li></ol></code><p>While comprehensible, this does not read very well. Most languages we&#8217;re used to, i.e. <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-european'>Indo-European languages</a>, read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Here, the flow of the program is expressed right-to-left, and there is no notion of top-down descent at all. If anything, there&#8217;s a notion of bottom-up ascent, if we for instance, lay out the program like this:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.1' href='#L.0.1'>Listing 0.1</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>(stack</pre></li><li><pre>  (dry</pre></li><li><pre>    (wash</pre></li><li><pre>      (split laundry))))</pre></li></ol></code><p>This reads like we&#8217;re putting the cart before the horse. Indeed, some tasks &mdash; such as, doing the laundry, cooking a meal, writing a program, etc. &mdash; are inherently sequential. Functional programming languages can be <span class='tooltip' title='A programming language has syntactic rules defining the valid positioning of symbols. In this case, the syntactic rule is that the name precedes the arguments in a function call.'>syntactically</span> unfit for writing such programs well.</p><p>We will develop the notion of a <em>well-written program</em> throughout these lecture notes, but we begin with the following definition:</p><a class='margin' name='D.0.0' href='#D.0.0'>Definition 0.0</a><dfn><p>A well-written program is a well-read program.</p></dfn><p>That is, a well-written program is comprehensible to another programmer. Naturally, not any old programmer will do, but someone with relative knowledge of the problem domain, and programming experience comparable, or superceeding yours, should be able to comprehend and evaluate your programs. The intent is to facilitate a the review and evolution of your programs by your peers.</p><p>We were also somewhat <em>declarative</em> when we wrote the functional program. For instance, we&#8217;ve left out the fact that we should wash whites before we wash colours. Actually, we didn&#8217;t even mention that we split the laundry into whites and colours; we&#8217;ve left it up to the <var>wash</var> and <var>split</var> function definitions to discuss such &#8220;details&#8221;.</p><a class='margin' name='D.0.1' href='#D.0.1'>Definition 0.1</a><dfn><p>A declarative style of programming is a style where we tell the reader &#8220;what&#8221; we&#8217;re doing, rather than &#8220;how&#8221; we&#8217;re doing it.</p></dfn><p>An alternative functional program could be:</p><a class='margin' name='L.0.2' href='#L.0.2'>Listing 0.2</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>let</pre></li><li><pre>  (dirtyWhites, dirtyColours) = split dirtyLaundry</pre></li><li><pre>  cleanWetWhites = wash dirtyWhites</pre></li><li><pre>  cleanWetColours = wash dirtyColours</pre></li><li><pre>  cleanLaundry = dry (cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours)</pre></li><li><pre>in</pre></li><li><pre>  stack cleanLaundry</pre></li></ol></code><p>We&#8217;ll refer to lines 1&ndash;7 as a &#8220;<tt>let</tt>-block&#8221;, lines 2&ndash;4 as a &#8220;<tt>let</tt>-definitions&#8221;, and line 7 as a &#8220;<tt>let</tt>-expression&#8221;.</p><p>In functional programming, the <tt>let</tt>-syntax can be used to reduce the complexity of an expression by giving intuitive names to subexpressions. This allows the reader to read the expression, and delve into the details of its constituents only if the reader wishes to do so. As long as important deails are retained, this is a useful technique for making your programs more readable.</p><p>In this particular case, the expression reduces to simply <code>stack cleanLaundry</code>. This seems overly declarative. We&#8217;re completely disregarding the important aspects of &#8220;doing the laundry&#8221;. We&#8217;re so eager not to tell the reader &#8220;how&#8221; we&#8217;re doing it, that we forget to tell the reader &#8220;what&#8221; we&#8217;re doing.</p><p>The <tt>let</tt>-syntax does however provide for a nice segway into another <span class='tooltip' title='A way of writing a particular class of programms well.'>programming paradigm</span>, more suitable for writing out <em>procedures</em>. In particular, the <tt>let</tt>-syntax provides more than a simple mechanism for naming subexpressions. Notice how we could use the name <var>dirtyWhites</var> when we defined <var>cleanWetWhites</var>, or how we could use <var>cleanWetWhites</var> when we defined <var>cleanLaundry</var>.</p><p>It is as if some sort of &#8220;state&#8221; is retained from one defintion to the next, such that names defined further up can be used in definitions further down. If we represent &#8220;state&#8221; as the set of names available for use in an expression we can specify how the state develops throughout the <tt>let</tt>-block: </p><a class='margin' name='L.0.3' href='#L.0.3'>Listing 0.3</a><code class='listing'><ol><li><pre>let</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry}</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours}</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours,</pre></li><li><pre>    cleanWetWhites}</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours,</pre></li><li><pre>    cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours}</pre></li><li><pre>in</pre></li><li><pre>  {dirtyLaundry, dirtyWhites, dirtyColours,</pre></li><li><pre>    cleanWetWhites, cleanWetColours, cleanLaundry}</pre></li></ol></code><p>It seems overly excessive to have the state at the <tt>let</tt>-expression (lines 9&ndash;10) contain all these &#8220;intermediate&#8221; names, such as <var>dirtyWhites</var>, <var>cleanWetColours</var>, etc. All we really want in the <tt>let</tt>-expression is the <var>cleanLaundry</var>. What&#8217;s more, it does not conceptually make sense to be able to use the dirty, or wet laundry once the laundry has been washed and dried, right? A more suitable programming paradigm would allow us to easily make sure that we don&#8217;t do such silly things as &#8220;doing the laundry&#8221; by &#8220;stacking the dirty laundry&#8221;.</p><p>While we could attempt to fix this using nested <tt>let</tt>-blocks or <span class='tooltip' title='Functions whos sole purpose is to make other functions easier to comprehend.'>auxiliary functions</span>, the final code will not be as easy as 1-2-3-4-5, i.e. as simple as our initial specification of the procedure.</p><p>The thing that is getting in the way here is that in functional programming we&#8217;re dealing with <em>immutable</em> values.</p><a class='margin' name='D.0.2' href='#D.0.2'>Definition 0.2</a><dfn><p> An immutable value cannot be mutated into another value. </p></dfn><p><b>Assignment</b></p><p>ASCII report.</p><p>The DIKU canteen is the only completely student-driven canteen on the Copenhagen University campus. The canteen was established in 1971, and runs till this day. As a student-driven canteen, even the accounting is done by students. No biggie for Datalogy students, eh? We&#8217;ll see.</p><p>It is possible to buy from the canteen in bulk. The usual order consists of perhaps 30 bottles of soft drinks, and 30 bottles of beer. Although all soft drinks have the same price, beer prices may vary depending on how enthusiastic you are about beer. Indeed, DIKU alumni and research groups can be quite a picky bunch when it comes to beer specialities. We can without loss of generality constrain ourselves to beer.</p><p>Every time a bulk purchase is made, the items and quantities purchased are noted in a journal, leaving it to accounting to handle later.</p><p>This is where you come in. We need to write a program that can process the journal and produce a summary report in ASCII. The summary report should process the entire journal and provide as output:</p><ul><li><p>the total number of times each type of beer was purchased;</p></li><li><p>the total revenue made from each type of beer;</p></li><li><p>the overall revenue from bulk purchases;</p></li><li><p>an overview of the development of the revenue over time.</p></li></ul><pre>Guld Tuborg 10
