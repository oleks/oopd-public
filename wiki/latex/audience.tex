These lecture notes are intended for a post-introductory programming course; in
particular, an introductory course in imperative, procedural, structured,
incremental, object-oriented, and basic generic programming. The course should
be preceded by an introductory course taught in a functional programming
language such as SML, Haskell, or alike.

From a programming point of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar
with the concepts of expression, assignment, if-branching, case-branching,
let-blocks, functions and composite data types; in particular, recursive,
higher-order, and generic functions and composite data types. From a
mathematical point of view, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with
basic discrete mathematics and basic asymptotic analysis.
