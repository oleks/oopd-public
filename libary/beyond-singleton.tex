\section{Types of singletons}

The singleton is among the simplest object-oriented design patterns, often
taught in basic object-oriented programming courses. However, what is rarely
taught is the number of different types of singletons that can be employed. The
choice of the type of singleton for your use case depends on how the singleton
is used, but all these methods share one thing -- the class is only ever
initialized once. The question is when exactly is the class initialized, and
when it makes sense for it to be initialized.

As a matter of fact, most books choose one of the types discussed in this
writing, and discuss that type in detail.

When the object is initialized

When the object is mentioned for the first time -- blind initialization, it doesn't matter who or when initializes it.

Whenever the object is accessed -- any access can initialize the object -- doesn't always make sense.

At a certain specific point in the application, e.g. a web-server initializes a request, and that request should be a singleton throughout the request lifetime.
